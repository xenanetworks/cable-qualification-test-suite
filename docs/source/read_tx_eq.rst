Importance of Logging TX Equalization Settings
==============================================

In addition to transceiver information, it is also important to log the host and module TX equalization settings in the test report. This ensures a comprehensive record of all relevant parameters affecting the cable's signal integrity and performance. By including these settings, users can:

* **Analyze Performance**: Understand how different equalization settings impact the overall performance of the cable.
* **Ensure Consistency**: Verify that the same settings are used across different tests for accurate comparison.
* **Optimize Settings**: Identify the optimal equalization settings for specific cables and environments.

By logging these settings, the test reports become more informative and valuable for making data-driven decisions.


Host TX Equalization Settings
----------------------------------

For the host, the following TX equalization settings should be logged per lane per port:

* Pre3 (dB)
* Pre2 (dB)
* Pre (dB)
* Main (mV)
* Post (dB)


Module TX Equalization Settings
------------------------------------

For the module, the following TX equalization settings should be logged per lane per port:

* Precursor (dB)
* Amplitude (dB)
* Postcursor (dB)
