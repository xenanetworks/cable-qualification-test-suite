FEC BER Test
===========================================

The FEC BER Test collects the pre-FEC and post-FEC BER data. The pre-FEC BER is the bit error rate before the FEC is applied. The post-FEC BER is the bit error rate after the FEC is applied.

Setup
-----

1. Test duration

Method
----------

1. Enable FEC on TX ports.
2. Clear FEC counters.
3. Measure pre-FEC BER and post-FEC BER on RX ports.
4. Report the time-series data of the pre-FEC BER and post-FEC BER.
